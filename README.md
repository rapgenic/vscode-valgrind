# Valgrind VSCode extension

This extension integrates the [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) dynamic analysis toolkit into VSCode, providing diagnostics gathered from an execution of the tool or from a xml log file.

## Features

* A new task type, `valgrind`, is available to quickly run the toolkit and automatically gather the diagnostic data
* A valgrind log file can be loaded and used as the source for the diagnostics (useful if valgrind cannot be run on the same machine)
* Full stack trace support
